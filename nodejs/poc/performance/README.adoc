= Blocking and Non Blocking POC

The `app.js` has two end points. One that does a syn call to `www.example.com` and another that does an async call.

They can be benchmarked by using apache benchmark:

----
$ ab -n 20 -c 5 http://localhost:3000/sync

$ ab -n 20 -c 5 http://localhost:3000/async
----
